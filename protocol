server                                  client
compute map, positions
                                        request 2 connections 
accept 
                                        sends char, name, type of packet 
stores fd
stores char, name in that id

sends id++ to the type game 
                                        receive id
                                        create three threads

cnt++
---

when cnt = N

create 2*N threads 
each thread gets conn_fd, game

game threads:
send the entire game object
                                        receive the entire game object

send game START

Multiplayer game for Networks Lab project.

Name of game? 
Ideas: GuruPI, 

A maze game with rules that may be found here soon.

As of now, some basic classes such as Map and Player implemented. 
make and run test.out to see awesomeness.
Allegro keyboard input s\not currently being used as it does not seem to work in text mode.

Need to make reading map from file better.
